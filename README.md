# hello-world
I'm making this repository because I have to.

Hey there, I'm Kevin Kraft, president, founder, CEO, blah blah blah, et cetera, et cetera, of Omega Gaming (yes, that is currently my official title). We're going through some radical changes. So far, we're only a little company that makes games in Multimedia Fusion to put on itch.io for free, but we're getting ready to release our first, real, paid game: Blinking Simulator. But before we can do anything like that, we have to think about who we are as a company. One major thing we need to look at is our name. Omega Gaming might not be the best name, so we should probably look for something else.

This is probably way more than I should have put in a fake readme, but whatever, I needed to get that off my chest.
